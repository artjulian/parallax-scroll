# Parallax Scroll JS
This library was created to solve a problem for creating parallax scrolling webpages without 
having to specifically target javascript to make it work. This library started with adapting 
[Richard Shepherd's Parallax Scrolling Tutorial](http://richardshepherd.com/smashing/parallax/background.html), The library has a 
great basis for vertically scrolling elements and served as an example for writing this library. 
In other words, thank you Richard!

#How to use
For now open the index.html in your favorite web browser and there you'll find some examples 
on which triggers and animations are available. As time permits, I will add instructions to 
this README and cater your needs.
